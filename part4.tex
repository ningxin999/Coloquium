    \item In engineering, sometimes it is difficult to tell which uncertainty is \alert{aleatoric} or \alert{epistemic} or \alert{mixed type}

    \item \alert{Aleatoric} uncertainty should be considered even it is \alert{irreducible}

    \item MCS is too expensive to force us to use a \alert{surrogate}

    \item Consider different types of uncertainty into Bayesian inference required \alert{linked with likelihood}

    \item MCMC is a good tool. But there exists some other alternatives.
